# PowerBi-Project
I've been working on a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard focused on analyzing attrition rates. Using a CSV file, I imported and transformed the data in Power Query, then created key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the attrition rate to gain deeper insights.

Key Insights:
Attrition by Age: Noticed higher attrition rates among younger employees, particularly those early in their careers.
Attrition by Education: Observed that employees with life science and medical as educational background levels show higher attrition compared to other degree holders
Attrition by Job Role: Certain job roles, particularly in high-demand technical fields, experience higher turnover.
Attrition by Salary: There's a clear correlation between lower salaries and higher attrition, suggesting compensation could be a key factor.
Attrition by Years at Company: Interestingly, employees who have been with the company for 0-3 years are at the highest risk of leaving.
The dashboard not only highlights these critical areas but also allows for interactive analysis, helping HR teams identify trends and make data-driven decisions to improve retention.
